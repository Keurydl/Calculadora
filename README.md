It optimizes the app for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note**: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!

If you‚Äôre not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them.

You don‚Äôt have to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments.
